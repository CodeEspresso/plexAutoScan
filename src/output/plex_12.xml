<Directory ratingKey="8168" key="/library/metadata/8168/children" guid="plex://artist/5d07bc02403c6402904a9c7d" type="artist" title="doa" summary="One of the longest-running institutions in Canadian punk rock, D.O.A. play tough, straightforward rock in a fast, loud, and hard-hitting style. While they have a pronounced sense of humor, they also have a strong progressive political stripe, and have been willing to decry war, economic injustice, corruption, and environmental issues in their music without compromising their rowdy image. Led by guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Joe Keithley -- also known to longtime fans by his stage name, Joey Shithead -- D.O.A. started out as a no-frills punk outfit on their early singles (collected on the album Bloodied But Unbowed: The Damage to Date 1978-1984), getting faster and louder on their second album, Hardcore &#39;81. They incorporated hard rock and metal influences on 1985&#39;s Let&#39;s Wreck the Party and 1987&#39;s True (North) Strong and Free. After a brief breakup, D.O.A. moved back to their punk roots on albums like 1995&#39;s The Black Spot and 1998&#39;s Festival of Atheists, and they continued to play tough, topical music on 21st century releases like 2002&#39;s Win the Battle and 2020&#39;s Treason.&#xD;&#xA;D.O.A.&#39;s founder, leader, and sole constant member is Joe Keithley, aka Joey Shithead. Keithley was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, on June 3, 1956, and when he was ten years old, he decided he wanted to play the drums after first seeing a band play up close at his sister&#39;s wedding. Keithley bought a kit financed by his paper route, and played in several bands with friends before going off to college with ambitions of becoming a civil rights lawyer. College was a poor fit for Keithley, and after four months he dropped out and moved into a squatter&#39;s commune in Lumby, British Columbia. He started a band with his fellow squatters called the Resurrection, who after a few poorly received gigs followed Keithley back to Burnaby. There, the group adopted the new name Stone Crazy, and after seeing a Ramones show in 1977, Stone Crazy took up punk rock, settling in Vancouver and calling themselves the Skulls. The band featured the newly renamed Joey Shithead on vocals, Simon Werner on guitar, Brian Roy Goble (aka Wimpy Roy or Sunny Boy Roy) on bass, and Ken Montgomery (aka Dimwit) on drums. A second guitarist, Brad Kent, would briefly play with the Skulls before traveling to America and working with San Francisco punks the Avengers.&#xD;&#xA;After five months in Toronto, where the Skulls had little luck breaking into the local scene, Keithley returned to Vancouver in 1978 and teamed with bassist Randy Rampage and drummer Chuck Biscuits (born Charles Montgomery and Dimwit&#39;s brother) to form a new band, D.O.A. Becoming regulars in Vancouver&#39;s small but lively punk community, D.O.A. self-financed and released a four-song 7&#34; in 1978. A copy made its way to a college radio station in San Francisco, where a track from the EP, &#34;Disco Sucks,&#34; earned plenty of airplay, prompting D.O.A. to drive down the coast to California for their first American shows. By the end of the year, D.O.A. released a second single, &#34;The Prisoner&#34; b/w &#34;Thirteen,&#34; and a North American tour followed in 1979, including a date opening for the Clash in Vancouver. D.O.A. also delivered third single &#34;World War 3&#34; b/w &#34;Whatcha Gonna Do?&#34; and added a second guitarist, Dave Gregg, but after a disastrous show at the University of British Columbia, Keithley fired his bandmates and briefly broke up the group. By March 1980, Keithley had a change of heart and re-formed the band with Rampage and Biscuits; they began work on their first album and traveled to Detroit to play a protest outside that year&#39;s Republican National Convention.&#xD;&#xA;By the end of 1980, D.O.A. introduced their debut album, Something Better Change, followed by relentless touring, including plenty of shows in California. Borrowing a phrase used to describe the faster and harder breed of punk emerging in the Golden State, D.O.A. called their second LP Hardcore &#39;81, giving the moniker a greater currency than it had before. By the end of 1981, Rampage and Biscuits were out of the band (Biscuits would later play with Black Flag, Danzig, and Social Distortion), and Skulls alumni Wimpy Roy and Dimwit were back on bass and drums alongside Keithley and Gregg. Keithley had struck up a friendship with Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, and Biafra&#39;s Alternative Tentacles label would release D.O.A.&#39;s next record, the 1982 EP War on 45. The group pushed their political stance forward with the 1983 Right to Be Wild single, the first of several benefit 7&#34; releases D.O.A. would issue, this one to raise money for the defense of the Squamish Five, a radical group responsible for several politically oriented bombings. (One of the five was a longtime friend and former bandmate of Keithley&#39;s, Gerry Hannah.) The band toured Europe in 1984, playing mostly squats and independent venues, and recorded a BBC Radio session for John Peel that was released that same year as the EP Don&#39;t Turn Yer Back on Desperate Times.&#xD;&#xA;1985&#39;s Let&#39;s Wreck the Party found D.O.A. incorporating more metal and hard rock elements into their music, though their politics remained firmly left of center. They also became one of the first Western punk bands to play in Poland as they once again toured Europe. In 1986, Dimwit quit the act, and Jon Card became their drummer in time to record 1987&#39;s True (North) Strong and Free, which was released in the United States by the successful rap and hard rock label Profile Records. The album included a cover of the Bachman-Turner Overdrive hit &#34;Taking Care of Business,&#34; which featured a guest spot from BTO guitarist Randy Bachman. (Drummer Jon Card died on April 8, 2024 at the age of 63.)  In 1988, Dave Gregg dropped out of D.O.A., and Chris Prohom (formerly of the Dayglo Abortions) took over on guitar. Prohom&#39;s recording debut with the band came with 1989&#39;s Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors, a collaborative LP with D.O.A. backing up Jello Biafra. The group were touring in support of 1990&#39;s Murder, another LP steeped in metal production, when Keithley was bashed in the face with a mike stand by a fan at a show in Dayton, Ohio. The incident led to Keithley breaking up D.O.A., staging a farewell tour of the West Coast before staging a final concert at Vancouver&#39;s Commodore Ballroom in December 1990. A live album recorded in 1989, Talk Minus Action Equals Zero, appeared as a postscript in 1991.&#xD;&#xA;In 1992, Keithley decided to give D.O.A. another chance; with Wimpy Roy on bass and Ken Jensen on drums, the band put out a new album, 13 Flavours of Doom, that put them squarely back in punk rock territory, while two compilations of vintage material were also issued, Bloodied But Unbowed: The Damage to Date 1978-1984 and The Dawning of a New Error. John Wright of NoMeansNo produced 13 Flavours and played keyboards on the sessions, and also played drums with D.O.A. for a brief spell after Ken Jensen died in a house fire. They also added guitarist Ford Pier for the recording of 1993&#39;s Loggerheads. Pier would leave D.O.A. before the recording of 1995&#39;s The Black Spot, and Keithley would be their sole guitarist from then on. Brien O&#39;Brien signed on as drummer shortly after the recording of The Black Spot, which was released in Canada by the short-lived, Virgin-distributed Essential Noise imprint. In 1996, Keithley ran for public office for the first time as a candidate for the Green Party; the following year, Wimpy Roy left D.O.A. due to financial concerns, and Kuba van der Pol took over on bass. Frustrated by the band&#39;s relationships with record labels, Keithley relaunched Sudden Death Records, the label he started to release D.O.A.&#39;s first singles and benefit releases. For their first LP on Sudden Death, 1998&#39;s Festival of Atheists, Keithley played both bass and drums, as van der Pol had drifted out of the lineup; the same year, they also brought out The Lost Tapes, a collection of rare and unreleased performances.&#xD;&#xA;In 1999, Joe &#34;Shithead&#34; Keithley (as he was credited) brought out his first solo album, the acoustic-oriented Beat Trash. Following the departure of Brien O&#39;Brien, D.O.A. brought aboard a new drummer who called himself the Great Baldini; he also doubled as an auto mechanic, a valuable addition for a band often on the road. In 2000, Kuba van der Pol officially left the act, and Randy Rampage, who had left D.O.A. in 1982, came back to the group. 2000 also saw Keithley run for office again, gaining 15 percent of the vote in the provincial election in British Columbia. 2002&#39;s Win the Battle featured guest vocals from Canadian pop punk star Bif Naked; following touring in North America, Europe, and Japan, Randy Rampage once again quit D.O.A. to return to his job as a longshoreman. Bassist Dan Yaremko signed on in 2003, appearing on 2004&#39;s Live Free or Die. 2008&#39;s Northern Avenger saw both Yaremko and the Great Baldini out of the lineup; Randy Rampage was back on bass, and Floor Tom Jones took over behind the drum kit, though by the time the group hit the road in support, Rampage had once again left and Yaremko had returned. The album was produced by Bob Rock, former guitarist with the Canadian alternative rock band the Payola$ who had gone on to produce Metallica, M&#246;tley Cr&#252;e, and Bon Jovi. Keithley and Floor Tom Jones were joined by bassist Dirty Dan Sedan for the recording of 2010&#39;s Talk - Action = 0 (not to be confused with the similarly titled 1991 live disc), but following the touring cycle for the LP, Jones parted company with D.O.A., and Jesse Pinner was in his place for the recording of 2012&#39;s We Come in Peace.&#xD;&#xA;In 2013, Keithley once again announced he was seeking office, this time with Canada&#39;s New Democratic Party, and that he was retiring D.O.A. to focus on his campaign, playing a farewell tour in early 2013. As before, retirement didn&#39;t agree with him, and in 2014 D.O.A. were back, with Keithley on vocals and guitar, Mike Hodsall on bass, and Paddy Duddy on drums. This turned out to be one of D.O.A.&#39;s more enduring lineups, recording 2015&#39;s Hard Rain Falling, 2018&#39;s Fight Back, and 2020&#39;s Treason. 2018 saw Keithley finally find success in electoral politics, winning a spot on the city council of Burnaby, where he helped to defeat the city&#39;s notoriously right-wing mayor, Derek Corrigan. Keithley also announced that he intended to keep D.O.A. alive, playing and recording as often as his new schedule would permit. ~ Mark Deming" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/8168/thumb/1753274695" addedAt="1753274458" updatedAt="1753274695">

After creating one of the first personal recording studios with an array of top synthesizer gear in the early &#39;70s, Tomita applied his visions for space-age synthesizer music to his favorite modern composers -- Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel -- though his recordings steered a course far beyond the sterile academics of Wendy Carlos and other synthesists. Born in Tokyo in 1932, Tomita grew up in China as well as Japan, studying composition and music theory as well as art history at Keio University. After graduation in 1955, Tomita began composing film, television, and theater music. He was awarded frequently during the &#39;50s and &#39;60s, and became perhaps the most well-known contemporary Japanese composer.&#xD;&#xA;By the early &#39;70s, Tomita was introduced to the seminal work of synthesizer gurus Wendy Carlos and Robert Moog, sparking his own interest in synthesized music. In 1973, he formed the electronic collective Plasma Music with musicians Kinji Kitashoji and Mitsuo Miyamoto, and spent more than a year stocking his home studio with electronics gear (including the Moog III used for Carlos&#39; Switched-On Bach). Tomita&#39;s first album, 1974&#39;s Snowflakes Are Dancing, electrified the Japanese public and even translated to an American classical audience, where it was nominated for four Grammy Awards. Successive albums Pictures at an Exhibition, The Firebird Suite, and his masterpiece Holst: The Planets infused the classical-synthesizer fusion craze of the &#39;70s with genuinely exciting, futuristic music instead of the bland, note-by-note translations favored by less visionary musicians. The Planets re-invoked the connection between synthesizer music and science fiction first broached in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet.&#xD;&#xA;Tomita began incorporating digital synth and early MIDI setups with 1982&#39;s Grand Canyon, and completely gutted his studio during the next two years during the transition from analog to digital with his Casio Cosmo system. Though he recorded more sparingly than in the &#39;70s, Tomita made frequent appearances at enormous concerts, including his 1984 Austrian show Mind of the Universe before 80,000 people, and at the Statue of Liberty centennial celebration two years later. Tomita was also awarded the honorary presidency of the Japan Synthesizer Programmers Association. In 2001, Tomita composed background music for the Tokyo Disney Sea theme park. He continued composing music for Japanese films throughout the 2000s, and released three albums available as SACD Hybrid Multichannel discs during the 2010s. In 2015, Tomita won the Japan Foundation Award in honor of his long-standing influence on the electronic music world. On May 5, 2016, Tomita died of cardiac failure at the age of 84. At the time of his death, he had been working on Dr. Coppelius, a musical dedicated to Japanese rocket scientist Hideo Itokawa. ~ John Bush" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5226/thumb/1753259746" addedAt="1753014519" updatedAt="1753259746">

<Directory ratingKey="5153" key="/library/metadata/5153/children" guid="plex://artist/5d07bc08403c6402904ae8dc" type="artist" title="Jascha Heifetz" summary="Jascha Heifetz was the leading figure among the extraordinary group of Russian Jews who dominated violin playing in the second and third quarters of the 20th century. As a technician he had no superior, and, of all the artists of his time and later, only two or three could even offer a challenge to his electrifying precision of execution. His diamond-point tone and quick vibrato afforded his playing a clarity of line that some felt was almost too perfect, even cold. Most conductors and other violinists -- and audiences -- felt differently and a Heifetz concert inevitably drew sell-out crowds.&#xD;&#xA;Heifetz was born in Vilna, where his father Ruvim was a violinist in the city theater. When he was three, his father bought for him a quarter-size instrument and gave him beginning instruction. By the age of five, Heifetz had advanced enough to enter the Vilna Conservatory, where he began instruction under Elias Malkin. Only a year later, Heifetz made his first public appearance performing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. The six-year-old was so successful that offers for other appearances came from numerous other venues in Russia and he was hailed as a real prodigy.&#xD;&#xA;When Leopold Auer, then a famous professor at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, came to Vilna in 1909, he was persuaded by Malkin to listen to Heifetz. After hearing him in Mendelssohn and Paganini, Auer embraced him and predicted for him a splendid future, urging him to come to St. Petersburg and become his pupil.&#xD;&#xA;Ruvim Heifetz resigned his position, sold the family belongings, and took his son to St. Petersburg, but Auer initially failed to recognize the boy and refused him admittance to his home. By the time Auer realized his error, the Conservatory entrance deadline had passed and Jascha had to enroll in the class of an assistant. Six months later, however, Heifetz was able enter Auer&#39;s class, and thereafter his progress was astounding.&#xD;&#xA;During an appearance at the International Exposition in Odessa, the reception accorded Heifetz was so explosive that a police escort was needed afterward. Concerts throughout Europe followed immediately and, at an appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1914, conductor Artur Nikisch declared that he had never heard violin playing such as his.&#xD;&#xA;Heifetz&#39;s American debut took place at Carnegie Hall in 1917, eliciting such observations as &#34;only the molten gold of Fritz Kreisler can be conjured up in comparison&#34; (Herbert F. Peyser) and &#34;He is a modern miracle&#34; (Pitts Sanborn). The ensuing year brought triumph after triumph, with critics vying with each other to offer the most extravagant superlatives. A period of transition a few years later brought some critical reservations as Heifetz sought to move away from the overt emotionalism of his Russian training and become a more objective player. By the mid-1920s, however, a balance had been struck and once again accolades flew as critics and audiences noted a new, more mature approach to his music.&#xD;&#xA;Heifetz became an American citizen, settled in California, and enjoyed the benefit of a long-term recording contract with RCA, amassing a sizable discography over the years. Throughout his career, Heifetz favored gut strings, perhaps to temper the fine-edged aggressiveness of his attack and the enormous strength of his bowing arm. Early recordings of concertos, made mostly overseas, were gradually redone -- though not supplanted -- with American orchestras and in improved sound. Nonetheless, many of the earlier releases, despite their having been done in short takes required by 78-rpm discs, still compel attention for their unsurpassed mastery. ~ Erik Eriksson" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5153/thumb/1753259771" art="/library/metadata/5153/art/1753259771" addedAt="1753014175" updatedAt="1753259771">

The Japanese guitarist, Kazuhito Yamashita, began to study the guitar at the age of eight with his father, Toru Yamashita. In 1972, aged eleven, he won the Kyushu Guitar Competition. Four years later, he was awarded First Prize in the All Japan Guitar Competition. In 1977, he won three important international competitions - the Ramirez in Spain, the Alessandria in Italy and Paris Radio France Competition, being the youngest winner ever recorded. In 1978, Yamashita made his debut in Japan and, in the following year, traveled to Europe. While still in his twenties, he made his first appearances in Canada (Toronto International Guitar Festival), the USA and Britain and gave a solo recital in the Musikverein (Grosser Saal) in Vienna. He has given solo recitals in concert halls around the world such as the Lincoln Centre and has performed with a variety of orchestras and conductors in Europe, North America and Asia. In 1989, the Casals Hall in Tokyo, considered to be one of the finest auditoriums in the world, presented a series called The World of Kazuhito Yamashita, comprising seven concerts in 12 months. The high point of the concerts was Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#39;s 24 Caprichos de Goya in a single performance. The series concluded with Bach&#39;s six sonatas and partitas over two consecutive nights; a recital series was continued in 1994 and 1999. In addition to solo performances, Kazuhito Yamashita also plays duo, as well as with chamber music ensembles, orchestras and internationally acclaimed artists, such as Leonard Slatkin with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Rafael Fr&#252;hbeck de Burgos, Antoni Ros Marb&#224;, Garcia Navaro, Pedro Halffter, Hiroyuki Iwaki, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Orquesta de la RTVE, Claudio Scimone e I Solisti Veneti, James Galway (flute), Gary Karr (double bass), Michala Petri (recorder), The Tokyo String Quartet etc. In the 4th Santo Tirso International Guitar Festival, held in 1997, he played four guitar concertos in one night with the Cordoba orchestra, conducted by Leo Brouwer. Most recently, he is active in the guitar quartet Kazuhito Yamashita &amp; Bambini. This quartet, consisting of Kazuhito Yamashita and his children, has performed at two international festivals in Italy, the Seoul Art Center in Korea, Portugal, Cordoba Festival in Spain, San Francisco Herbst Theatre and several cities throughout Japan. Yamashita has an impressive list of almost 80 recordings and numerous original arrangements of such works as Mussorgski&#39;s Pictures at an Exhibition, Stravinsky&#39;s Firebird, Rimsky-Korsakov&#39;s Scherezade and Dvorak&#39;s Symphony of the New World. He has recorded for BMG (RCA), Crown Classics, Japan Victor, King Records and Alfa Records. His recordings include 16 CD&#39;s with the complete works of Fernando Sor, and a collection of 5 CD&#39;s containing J.S. Bach&#39;s sonatas and partitas for violin, cello, lute and flute (BWV 995-1013), all which he himself transcribed for the guitar. His long-awaited recording of Mussorgsky&#39;s Pictures at an Exhibition, released in 1981, merited the prestigious Deutsches Grammophon Award. Kazuhito Yamashita is an enthusiastic proponent of new works for the guitar and has given the world premier of more than 60 new compositions. In this regard, his world premier and presentation of the works of the Japanese composer Keiko Fujiie is notable. In 1999, he received the National Arts Festival Grand Prize from the Japanese Government&#39;s Agency for Cultural Affairs for his CD recording of Japanese Guitar Music 1923-1948. Yamashita&#39;s early arrangements of Pictures at an Exhibition, Stravinsky&#39;s Firebird Suite, Dvorak&#39;s New World Symphony no. 9 in E Minor, and others, broke boundaries in terms of solo guitar expression and virtuosity.

He exhibited a remarkable ear and musical memory when very young; he had perfect pitch and sang back what he heard. He was taken at age five to study violin with Karl Moldrem. At age seven he started studying piano with Fanchon Armitage. When he became fascinated with conducting, his parents took him to symphony concerts, then arranged for him to have lessons with Vladimir Bakaleinikov, then assistant conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. At the age of eight, the University of Idaho Orchestra visited Los Angeles. Bakaleinikov arranged for his eight-year-old pupil to conduct them in Schubert&#39;s &#34;Unfinished&#34; B-minor symphony. (Maazel was quick with languages as well; he learned to speak Russian from studying with Bakaleinikov.) In 1938, Bakaleinikov obtained a position as assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. The Maazel family followed him east so that Lorin could continue his studies with him. Lorin went to the National Music Camp at Interlochen, MI in the summer. On August 18, 1939, the National Music Camp Orchestra appeared at the New York World&#39;s Fair, and Lorin conducted it in a work. His appearance created a sensation, although some critics were negative, comparing the feat to the performance of a trained seal.&#xD;&#xA;However, by 1941, Maazel had shown that he was a real conductor. He led an entire concert by the NBC Symphony Orchestra, earning a commendation from its music director, Arturo Toscanini. The next year, he conducted a complete program with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted a few other orchestras, including the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. At that point, a halt was called to such displays, and Maazel concentrated on rounding out his education. He concentrated on the violin and gave his first recital on the instrument in Pittsburgh in 1945. In the same year he became first violinist of the Fine Arts Quartet. In 1948 he joined the orchestra as a member of the violin section. He was appointed &#34;apprentice conductor&#34; of the orchestra in 1949 and occupied that position until 1951. In that year he went to Italy on a Fulbright Scholarship for research in Baroque music. There, his first conducting appearance as an adult took place on December 21, 1952, in Catania. He began conducting elsewhere in Italy, then in Austria and Germany. He conducted at the Florence May Festival in 1955, at the Vienna Festival in 1957, and made his London debut in 1960 in a BBC Symphony Orchestra concert, making the then-rare choice of a Mahler Symphony, being praised for the performance&#39;s power and for his control over the structure of the work. In the same year he conducted Wagner&#39;s Lohengrin at the Bayreuth Festival, being the first American to conduct at the annual Wagner Festival there.&#xD;&#xA;In 1962 he led the National Orchestra of France on an American tour; On November 1 of the same year he made a debut at the Metropolitan Opera leading Mozart&#39;s Don Giovanni. He then began touring widely as a guest conductor. He visited Japan and the U.S.S.R. in 1963. In 1965, he both conducted and produced a performance of Tchaikovsky&#39;s opera Eugene Onegin. In the same year, he was appointed artistic director of the Deutsche Opera in West Berlin (1965-1971) and the (West) Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (1965-1975). As head of the opera company, he conducted mostly standard repertory, and premiered Luigi Dallapiccola&#39;s opera Ulisse in 1968. While he ended his opera association in 1971, he retained the orchestral post, as well as taking on the positions of associate principal conductor of the New Philharmonic Orchestra of London (1970-1972) and music director of the Cleveland Orchestra (1972-1982), accepting the very difficult job of filling the shoes of the just-deceased conductor George Szell. Maazel filled that position with excellent results. The orchestra stayed at the same level of discipline and took on a rather more colorful surface to essentially the same &#34;Cleveland sound&#34; that Szell had instilled in them. He led the orchestra on ten major international tours and produced fine recordings with several record companies, including making some of the earliest and best-sounding recordings in the new digital technology with Telarc Records of Cleveland. He expanded the scope of the orchestra&#39;s repertory, bringing in new European works in styles that had not been to Szell&#39;s liking. He began producing staged operas within the regular concert season of the orchestra.&#xD;&#xA;A very hard worker, Maazel also guest conducted considerably and in 1976 added another orchestra when he was appointed principal guest conductor of the New Philharmonic Orchestra (until 1980), and yet another in 1977 as chief conductor of the French National Orchestra (until 1982, when he became principal guest conductor (until 1988 when he became Music director (until 1991). In the midst of this he became the regular conductor of the famous Vienna Philharmonic New Year&#39;s Day Concerts, which he retained through the 1986 concert. He resigned from his Cleveland position and was named music director emeritus in 1982. In that year he began a four-year contract as artistic director and general manager of the Vienna State Opera, the first American to hold that position. However, a change of leadership in Austria&#39;s Ministry of Culture resulted in political squabbles over artistic policies, and Maazel felt compelled to resign in 1984 He became &#34;music consultant&#34; to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1984, was named its music adviser and principal guest conductor in 1986, and in 1988 was made its music director (until 1996). Other appointments included the Bavarian Radio Symphony (1993-2002); the New York Philharmonic (2002-2009); the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana (2006-2011); and from 2004, Arturo Toscanini Philharmonic. His last appointment began in 2011 as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic.&#xD;&#xA;Maazel had a distinguished recording career. He won the Grand Prix de Disque of Paris and the Edison Prize from the Netherlands. His recording for Deutsche Grammophon of Ravel&#39;s opera &#34;L&#39;Enfant et les Sortileges&#34; is a classic that has never been out of print and has been counted as the greatest recording of that masterwork since it appeared in the 1960s. He conducted the complete symphonies of Sibelius and Tchaikovsky with the Vienna Philharmonic in the 1960s for Decca (London); the former, in particular, is one of the distinguished recordings of the great Finnish composer&#39;s seven symphonies. Maazel also maintained his skills as a violinist; one of his famous recordings was as soloist and conductor in the five Mozart violin concertos with the English Chamber Orchestra.&#xD;&#xA;Maazel was married three times: to Brazilian-American pianist Miriam Sandbank and to Israeli pianist Israela Margalit; both marriages ended in divorce; and to Dietlinde Turban. He received the Sibelius Prize of Finland, the Commander&#39;s Cross of the Order of Merit from West Germany, and other honors and honorary degrees. ~ Joseph Stevenson" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5161/thumb/1754166554" addedAt="1753014216" updatedAt="1754166554">

Her career was notable not only for her artistic achievements -- which were many -- but also for a dignified tenacity in the face of discrimination. She opened doors for subsequent generations of Black American singers.&#xD;&#xA;Anderson was born on February 27, 1897, in Philadelphia. Having sung since childhood and subsequently studied with a number of teachers in her native city, Anderson first rose to prominence when she appeared with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1925. In the early &#39;30s, she made a successful concert tour of Europe and solidified her growing reputation with further appearances in New York and London.&#xD;&#xA;In 1939, Anderson scheduled an appearance at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., but was denied the use of the building by its owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution, who objected to the presentation of a Black performer. Eleanor Roosevelt resigned her membership in the DAR in protest of this decision and then scheduled an appearance for Anderson at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday. The resulting concert, attended by thousands and broadcast nationwide, forever established Anderson as an ambassador for racial progress -- a role she embraced with great pride and success for the remainder of her career. Fittingly, Anderson&#39;s 1955 appearance at the Metropolitan Opera marked the first by an African-American singer, preparing the way for such future stars as Leontyne Price and Shirley Verrett.&#xD;&#xA;Marian Anderson&#39;s voice was dark, rich, and possessed of great power and agility. Her repertoire ranged from opera and concert material to Negro spirituals, and she brought to all things a great sense of commitment and integrity. Arturo Toscanini is noted to have remarked that a voice like hers only appears &#34;once in a hundred years.&#34; Her extraordinary range extended all the way down to the D below middle C -- as displayed in her performances of Schubert&#39;s song Death and the Maiden (Der Tod und das M&#228;dchen) -- as well as upwards into soprano territory (as an exercise, she even sang the devastatingly difficult &#34;Casta diva&#34; from Bellini&#39;s Norma). While her voice was most distinctive in the lower range, she was also capable of lightening it almost to leggiero proportions -- as she did in works of Handel and other Baroque composers -- and of bringing a near-ideal combination of classical training and folk-like spontaneity to the spirituals that were an integral part of her concert and recording repertoire. Anderson died on April 8, 1993, in Portland, Oregon. ~ TiVo Staff" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5218/thumb/1753259802" art="/library/metadata/5218/art/1753259802" addedAt="1753014392" updatedAt="1753259802">

<Directory ratingKey="3372" key="/library/metadata/3372/children" guid="plex://artist/5d07bc5f403c6402904f74b7" type="artist" title="Martha Argerich" summary="Martha Argerich is widely considered one of the greatest pianists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Unusually, her genius reveals itself mostly in collaborations with orchestras and conductors in concertos, and with chamber musicians. Stretching well back into the LP era, her recording catalog is vast. Its growth has slowed only slightly in her senior years, and in 2025, she released an album of works by Ravel on the Warner Classics label.&#xD;&#xA;Of Catalan and Russian Jewish background, Argerich was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on June 5, 1941. She started piano lessons at five and made rapid progress, performing concertos by Mozart and Beethoven flawlessly just three years later. Her family moved to Switzerland in 1955, and she studied with Madeleine Lipatti, Nikita Magaloff, and then, for 18 months, with Friedrich Gulda in Vienna after Argentine president Juan Per&#243;n arranged for diplomatic work for her family there. Argerich won the Geneva International Competition and the Ferruccio Busoni International Competition in 1957, and she made a well-regarded debut album in 1960 featuring music by Liszt, Prokofiev, Ravel, Brahms, and Chopin. However, her real breakthrough was a first prize at the Chopin International Festival in Warsaw in 1965; she was the first pianist from the Western hemisphere to triumph, and the win brought publicity similar to that which attended Van Cliburn&#39;s International Tchaikovsky Competition victory in Moscow in 1958. Her live recordings of Chopin&#39;s concertos that year remain early classics. Another early recording was one of Tchaikovsky&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23, on the Deutsche Grammophon label in 1973. Argerich began a long association with the Deutsche Grammophon label in the &#39;70s, and her 1975 release featuring concertos by Prokofiev and Ravel, with the Berlin Philharmonic under Claudio Abbado, had an iconic cover photo showing the two in intense conversation. Her 1985 recording of Tchaikovsky&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B flat minor, Op. 23, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Charles Dutoit, was another classic.&#xD;&#xA;After her early years, Argerich rarely gave solo concerts, sometimes saying that she felt lonely on stage. She recorded concertos, mostly from the late Romantic and early modern periods, with most of the major European conductors. Dutoit was one of Argerich&#39;s three husbands; before him came composer Robert Chen, and after him, pianist Stephen Kovacevich, and she had children with all three. Argerich recovered from a 1990 bout with malignant melanoma and a 1995 recurrence; she was cured by an experimental treatment at the John Wayne Cancer Institute and performed a Carnegie Hall concert to benefit the Institute. She has continued to give widely praised concerto performances into senior citizenhood, appearing at the BBC Proms in 2016 with conductor Daniel Barenboim in the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 in E flat major. She has also been an enthusiastic performer of chamber music and duo sonatas, appearing and recording with Kovacevich, pianist Nelson Freire, violinist Gidon Kremer, and other choice players. In her later years, Argerich was widely known for her leadership of the Progetto Martha Argerich at the Lugano Festival in Switzerland, where she performed with and nurtured the careers of many young musicians.&#xD;&#xA;That festival came to an end in 2016 after its sponsor was investigated for possible violations of Swiss banking laws, but in 2018, she curated a new festival mounted by the Hamburg Philharmonic, and she has continued to serve as director of the Argerich Music Festival in Beppu, Japan, which she created in 1996. In 2019, she had a busy schedule of concerts across Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. Her concerts generally take up the mainstream of the concerto and chamber repertory, from Mozart to the early 20th century, but she has performed more contemporary music by her compatriot Alberto Ginastera, Witold Lutoslawski, and others. Argerich has continued to record for Deutsche Grammophon but has also appeared on Warner, Decca, and other labels. Her recording pace hardly slowed in her sixties and seventies; in the year 2015 alone, 11 separate Argerich recordings appeared (some were reissues of earlier material). In 2020, Argerich was heard on a new recording of Beethoven&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat major, Op. 19, with conductor Seiji Ozawa and his Mito Chamber Orchestra in Japan. She has recorded at least annually in the 2020s; the year 2021 saw the appearance of six Argerich recordings. In 2025, she released the album Ravel: Adagio assai from Piano Concerto in G; Ma m&#232;re l&#39;oye; Gaspard de la nuit. By that time, her catalog included at least 200 recordings. ~ James Manheim" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/3372/thumb/1731847944" art="/library/metadata/3372/art/1731847944" addedAt="1753009541" updatedAt="1731847944">

She often appears in concert with her husband, Lars Hannibal, a guitarist and lutenist.&#xD;&#xA;Petri was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 7, 1958. She first played the recorder at three and then began lessons at five. The year 1969 was pivotal for the young artist; her concerto debut took place in Tivoli, and she also began studies in Hannover, West Germany, at the Staatliche Hochschule f&#252;r Musik und Theater under Ferdinand Conrad. Petri enjoyed great success performing in the Petri Trio with her harpsichordist mother, Hanne, and cellist brother, David, throughout the 1970s, and from 1981, she played in a duo with her mother. Petri&#39;s first recording dates to 1975, but she first achieved international acclaim with the 1980 Philips recording of Six Flute Concertos, Op. 10, by Vivaldi. She and Hannibal have conducted many successful tours abroad, including to the U.S., Japan, and throughout Europe, and they have appeared on several recordings together. In 1995, Petri was awarded the rank of Knight of Dannebrog by the Queen of Denmark, and in 2000, Petri was given Denmark&#39;s most prestigious music award, the Leonie Sonning Music Prize.&#xD;&#xA;Petri&#39;s repertory is extensive, especially in the Baroque realm, with works by J.S. Bach, Telemann, Sammartini, and many others, but she also plays music from later periods, including more than 100 other works written specifically for her. In addition, she has regularly performed numerous transcriptions of compositions by Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert, among others, and a spate by Scandinavian composers: Grieg, Alfv&#233;n, Nielsen, and many others. Petri has made dozens of recordings spread over several labels, including RCA, Sony, Deutsche Grammophon, and her own label, OUR Recordings.&#xD;&#xA;In 2009, Petri began a project to commission concertos from composers from various countries. The first fruit of this appeared on the Grammy-nominated album Chinese Recorder Concertos. This was followed in 2012 by English Recorder Concertos, made with the City Chamber Orchestra of Hong Kong. The year 2015 brought Danish and Faroese Recorder Concertos, and the following year, those from Germany and France. Although it was not part of the commissioning project, Petri&#39;s 2017 release Brazilian Landscapes also featured music with a national origin unusual for her instrument.&#xD;&#xA;She has continued to record both Baroque repertory, as on 2012&#39;s Blockfl&#246;tenkonzerte: H&#228;ndel, Marcello, Samartini, Telemann, Vivaldi (recorded for the Decca label), and works by contemporary composers, often freshly commissioned and issued by the OUR Recordings imprint. In 2019, she issued the album American Recorder Concertos on OUR Recordings, also joining harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani and viola da gamba player Hille Perl that year for a new recording of Bach&#39;s sonatas for recorder, harpsichord, and viola da gamba. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she released albums of recorder music by Lars Hannibal and Sunleif Rasmussen, reuniting with Esfahani and Perl in 2023 for the album Corellimania. ~ James Manheim &amp; Robert Cummings" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5295/thumb/1753259782" addedAt="1753014863" updatedAt="1753259782">

His composition Turangalila Symphonie, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1949, fused rhythms of classical Indian music and western pop influences. From 1930 until his death in 1992, Messiaen served as organist and composer at Eglise De La Trinite in Paris.&#xD;&#xA;Messiaen inherited his creative skills from his parents. His mother was poet Cecile Sauvage, while his father helped to translate Shakespeare into French. Composing music by the age of eight, Messiaen advanced quickly. After learning to read music, he successfully tackled the operatic scores of Mozart, Gluck, Berlioz, and Wagner. He was only 11 years old when he began studying at the Paris Conservatory.&#xD;&#xA;Accepting a position as organist at La Trinite in 1930, Messiaen was inducted into Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris six years later. Messiaen&#39;s musical career was interrupted when he enlisted as a medical orderly in the French army in 1939. Captured by German forces the following year, he was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Silesia. While imprisoned, he continued to work on his music. Despite the lack of a piano, he composed, The Quartet for the End of Time, premiering the piece for an audience comprised of more than five-thousand prisoners.&#xD;&#xA;In 1941, after securing his freedom and being discharged from the army, Messiaen taught harmony at the Paris Conservatory. Between 1943 and 1947, he conducted seminars on musical analysis and composition to a small, private group that included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.&#xD;&#xA;Messiaen continued to balance his work at Eglise de la Trinite with commissioned compositions. The French government commissioned him to compose a piece, Et Expecto Resurrectionem Mortuorum, in memory of those who died in the World Wars. The following year, he taught composition at the Paris Conservatory. ~ Craig Harris" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5340/thumb/1753259856" addedAt="1753014982" updatedAt="1753259856">

<Directory ratingKey="5145" key="/library/metadata/5145/children" guid="plex://artist/5d07bc05403c6402904abd00" type="artist" title="Placido Domingo" summary="One of the world&#39;s most renowned tenors, Pl&#225;cido Domingo -- along with his frequent collaborators Luciano Pavarotti and Jos&#233; Carreras -- is largely responsible for the increasing mainstream popularity of opera among contemporary listeners. He became established quickly as one of the greatest lyric tenors of his time, and one who could also sing dramatic tenor roles with nearly equally fine results. Domingo&#39;s forays into Latin and pop music were also successful, earning him Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards as well as silver, gold, platinum, and multi-platinum-selling albums. As his voice deepened with age in the 2010s, he continued to perform as a baritone.&#xD;&#xA;Born March 21, 1941, in Madrid, Spain, Domingo&#39;s parents were both singers in the zarzuela, Spain&#39;s distinctive national form of musical theater. His family relocated to Mexico in 1950; there he studied vocal technique, as well as piano and conducting, at the Mexico City Conservatory. His operatic debut was in the small role of Borsa in Verdi&#39;s Rigoletto with the National Opera in Mexico City in 1959. His first appearance in the leading tenor role was as Alfredo in Verdi&#39;s La Traviata in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1960. Subsequently, he spent close to three years with the Israel National Opera, singing 280 performances in a dozen different roles. His debut with the Metropolitan Opera Company was in a Lewisohn Stadium concert performance of Cavalleria Rusticana, as Turiddu, August 9, 1966. His Metropolitan Opera debut was on September 28, 1968, as Maurice de Saxe in Adriana Lecouvreur -- the first of well over 400 performances at the legendary venue.&#xD;&#xA;In the years to follow, Domingo&#39;s stature grew on the strength of regular performances at the world&#39;s most famed opera houses, among them La Scala, the Vienna State Opera, London&#39;s Covent Garden, the Op&#233;ra de la Bastille in Paris, the San Francisco Opera, Chicago&#39;s Lyric Opera, and the Los Angeles Music Center Opera (which he co-founded). His recordings included performances with sopranos such as Rosalind Plowright, Katria Ricciarelli, and Montserrat Caballe.&#xD;&#xA;During the &#39;80s, Domingo broadened his horizons. He added pop and Latin music to his repertoire, scoring a Top 20 hit with the 1981 John Denver duet &#34;Perhaps Love&#34; from the album of the same name, and winning a Best Latin Pop Performance Grammy in 1985 for Siempre en Mi Coraz&#243;n (Always in My Heart), a collection of Ernesto Lecuona songs. He also appeared in several filmed operas, including Franco Zeffirelli&#39;s La Traviata in 1982, Franco Rossi&#39;s Carmen in 1984, and Zeffirelli&#39;s Otello in 1986.&#xD;&#xA;However, Domingo&#39;s greatest popularity came as one of the Three Tenors, a trio featuring Pavarotti and Carreras, whose albums and live concert videos enjoyed mainstream success not enjoyed by operatic recordings in many decades. The Three Tenors&#39; 1990 debut album became one of the best-selling classical albums of all time, and they continued to perform and record until 2003. In 1992, Domingo began the Christmas in Vienna series of concerts and albums, which featured vocalists such as Carreras, Diana Ross, Charles Aznavour, Tony Bennett, and many others.&#xD;&#xA;During the &#39;90s and 2000s, Domingo&#39;s behind-the-scenes work in opera and the arts increased. Having established a relationship with the Washington National Opera in the &#39;80s, he became its Artistic Director in 1996, a position he held until 2011. Meanwhile, he became Artistic Director of the Los Angeles Opera in 2000, ultimately taking on the role of General Director in 2003. He also founded the international opera competition Operalia and became the president of Europa Nostra, a European cultural heritage federation.&#xD;&#xA;Along with these responsibilities, Domingo continued to perform, though his roles were changing. He performed in more Wagnerian operas and Russian-language operas such as Tchaikovsky&#39;s The Queen of Spades. He also added new roles in classic and modern operas including Arrigo in Verdi&#39;s La Battaglia di Legnano and Tan Dun&#39;s The First Emperor. Domingo earned particular acclaim for his performance as Tristan in the 2005 EMI Classics studio recording of Tristan und Isolde, which featured Operalia winner Nina Stemme in the other lead role. In 2009, Domingo switched to baritone parts, starting with Verdi&#39;s Simon Boccanegra and following it with roles in the composer&#39;s Rigoletto, I due Foscari, La Traviata, and Macbeth, among others. He also continued to record classical and pop albums. His 2011 collection of Verdi baritone arias won a Latin Grammy Award; other projects included 2012&#39;s Songs, which featured collaborations with Josh Groban and Susan Boyle, the 2015 holiday album My Christmas, and an appearance on Il Volo&#39;s Notte Magica: A Tribute to the Three Tenors in 2016. Another seasonal collection, Placido Domingo &amp; Friends Celebrate Christmas in Vienna, arrived in 2017. ~ Jason Ankeny" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5145/thumb/1754166743" art="/library/metadata/5145/art/1754166743" addedAt="1753014145" updatedAt="1754166743">

In a review of his 1985 Carnegie Hall concert, Variety wrote, &#34;(Clayderman&#39;s) main appeal lies in his youth and boyish good looks...coupled with his gentlemanly charm and his thick French accent, they promise to rope in the romantically inclined middle-aged Yank ladies who cotton to this ilk of soothing entertainment.&#34; Nancy Reagan referred to Clayderman as &#34;the prince of romance.&#34; Instructed in classical piano by his father, Clayderman enrolled in the Paris Conservatory of Music at the age of 12. Four years later, he placed first in a piano competition at the school. Despite his classical background, Clayderman opted for popular music when he launched his professional career. A tour as opening act for French rock musician Johnny Hallyday introduced him to an international following. Clayderman&#39;s debut album, Ballade Pour Adeline, recorded at the urging of producers and composers Oliver Toussaint and Paul de Senneville in 1977, sold more than 20 million copies and was distributed in 38 countries. Clayderman, who took his stage name from his Swedish grandmother, has continued to tour throughout the world to enthusiastic audiences. A live concert broadcast on Chinese television in 1987 attracted more than 800 million viewers.&#xD;&#xA;His vast discography of well over 200 albums, released on and licensed to many different labels worldwide, has seen him record everything from light classics to Andrew Lloyd Webber love songs, Bollywood movie soundtracks, and the folk music of Germany, Turkey, and Japan. While this willingness to turn his hand to anything fueled his worldwide popularity, it is the unthreatening homogeneity of his output that won him a loyal, late-middle-aged fanbase similar to that of another European titan of light classical music, Andr&#233; Rieu. In the early 2010s, Clayderman enjoyed an upsurge in mainstream popularity, perhaps partly as a kitsch nostalgia act, but also on the part of canny marketing men who positioned him as part of that era&#8217;s classical crossover explosion. His 2013 album for Decca, Romantique -- arguably his highest-profile release ever -- featured a m&#233;lange of film music, pop and light classical standards, and a re-recording of his best-known tune, &#34;Ballade pour Adeline&#34;. ~ Craig Harris &amp; John D.

He has been unusually successful in combining jazz and classical careers.&#xD;&#xA;Stoltzman was born on July 12, 1942, in Omaha, Nebraska, but moved with his family to San Francisco at a young age; his father was a Western Pacific railroad worker who enjoyed the music of the big bands and played the alto saxophone. The young Stoltzman&#39;s first music was jazz. He took up the clarinet at eight and was soon joining his father in Bay Area jazz venues. Both Stoltzmans sang in a church choir where Richard would cue off-pitch singers with his clarinet, trying to make it sound like a voice. He later credited this experience for his distinctively warm tone quality. Stoltzman attended The Ohio State University, studying mathematics and music, graduating in 1964. He chose the latter definitively, enrolling at Yale for graduate studies (earning a master&#39;s degree in 1967) and studied further at the Marlboro Music School and Festival. There he made the acquaintance of a group of collaborators that included pianist Peter Serkin, cellist Pablo Casals, and violinist Ida Kavafian. Together with Serkin and Kavafian, he formed the chamber group TASHI (a Tibetan term meaning good fortune) in 1973. Stoltzman was the first clarinetist to give solo recitals at both the Hollywood Bowl and Carnegie Hall, where he made his New York solo debut in 1974.&#xD;&#xA;His jazz career also developed during this period. In his concert appearances, he joined an impressive variety of classic and modern performers, including vocalist Mel Torm&#233;, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and keyboardist Chick Corea, as well as folk-pop star Judy Collins. He was the first performer to feature jazz during a recital at the legendary Bayreuth Opera House. His classical collaborators have included cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Christoph Eschenbach, and he has appeared as a soloist with numerous major symphony orchestras in the U.S. and abroad. Beginning in 1982 with a classic recording of the Brahms clarinet sonatas, Stoltzman had a long association with the RCA label. In 1986, Stoltzman became the first wind player to win the Avery Fisher Prize, given for outstanding performance by an American musician.&#xD;&#xA;Stoltzman was featured in the series Concerto! on the BBC in 1993, performing Copland&#39;s Clarinet Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra. As a recording artist, he worked extensively with Bill Douglas (touring and recording together for 30 years) and released one of his most popular recordings, Begin Sweet World, in 1986. Later, he recorded for MMC, Navona, and, beginning in 2019, Avie, where he issued an album recorded jointly with his wife, jazz marimbist Mika Stoltzman, titled Palimpsest. In 2023, Stoltzman returned on the Navona label, performing the Concertante for clarinet and orchestra on an album of works by composer Anthony Iannaccone. By that time, his recording catalog comprised some 75 items. Stoltzman maintained a full schedule of concert performances in 2022, with many devoted to Corea&#39;s music. ~ James Manheim" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5319/thumb/1753259861" addedAt="1753014919" updatedAt="1753259861">

The R.S.C. gave many memorable concerts and made numerous recordings for the RCA label, beginning at the close of the 78 rpm age in 1948 and ending in the heart of the stereo LP era in 1965. Shaw and his Chorale made the first classical recording to sell over one million copies and they received numerous citations, including several Grammy awards. In fact, Shaw, with his Chorale and other choral groups, was awarded 14 Grammys during his career.&#xD;&#xA;Robert Shaw (1916-1999) had established a reputation as one of the finest American choral conductors in the 1930s and 1940s. Having greatly impressed Fred Waring as leader of the Pomona College Glee Club, Shaw was asked to serve as conductor of the Fred Waring Glee Club, a post he accepted in 1938. He left it in 1945, steeped in other assignments, including rehearsing the NBC Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus for Toscanini.&#xD;&#xA;Shaw formed the Robert Shaw Chorale in 1948 in New York City. The Robert Shaw Chorale consisted of about 40 professional singers, whose numbers often varied. The R.S.C.&#39;s initial recordings were made in 1948 for RCA Victor, the first with Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, in a performance of Brahms Gesang der Parzen, and the second, of highlights from Saint-Sa&#235;ns&#39; Samson and Delilah, with Stokowski and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Numerous others would follow, including the 1950 recordings of the Mozart Requiem and Verdi operas Rigoletto and Falstaff, the latter with Toscanini. The R.S.C. also began doing lighter repertory, with recordings of Gershwin&#39;s Porgy and Bess in 1950 and two collections from 1951, A Treasury of Easter Songs and Joy to the World. Later forays into more popular fare included the 1956 My True Love Sings and the 1958 The Stephen Foster Songbook. The group toured throughout the 1950s and 1960s, perhaps their grandest being the 36-city excursion through the United States in 1960 where the group, comprised of 33 singers, also took along 29 instrumentalists. Their performance of the Bach Mass in B minor at the Manhattan Center on that tour was among their more memorable concerts. The R.S.C. was perhaps at its height during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the group&#39;s popularity spilled over into many areas. For example, their 1959 recordings entitled The Lord&#39;s Prayer and Ave Maria were done with the then-famous singer and television star Perry Como. After having achieved such popularity, it may seem difficult to comprehend why the group would disband in 1965, but Shaw moved onto other ventures, the most important of which was carrying out the duties of music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra beginning in 1967. New recordings by the Robert Shaw Chorale continued to be issued well into 1967. Thereafter, reissues began to appear regularly, though they began tapering off in the 1990s. By 2002, about 40 recordings by the R.S.C. were widely available, mostly on the RCA label." index="1" addedAt="1753014277" updatedAt="1753259875">

Ozawa was noted for his advocacy of contemporary music, even early in his career, when such a thing was rare among American orchestra conductors of top rank.&#xD;&#xA;Ozawa was born in Mukden, in Japanese-occupied northeastern China (now Shenyang, China), on September 1, 1935. He started piano lessons at seven, and when the family returned to Japan in 1944, he got serious about lessons, studying the music of Bach intensively. With dreams of a career as a concert pianist, Ozawa enrolled at Tokyo&#39;s Toho Gakuen School of Music. His keyboard career came to an end, however, when he broke both his index fingers while playing rugby. A sympathetic teacher, Hideo Saito, took him to see a performance of Beethoven&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major, Op. 73 (&#34;Emperor&#34;). Far from regretting his lost opportunity, Ozawa became fascinated by the role of the conductor, at the time a rare occupation among Japanese musicians. He conducted Japan&#39;s NHK Symphony Orchestra and Japan Philharmonic during his student years, and after finishing his studies in Tokyo, he headed for Europe with hopes of undertaking further studies. He had to support himself for a time as a motor scooter salesman, but when he saw a poster for the International Competition of Orchestra Conductors in Besan&#231;on, France, in 1959, he entered the contest and won. Even better, one of the judges was Boston Symphony conductor Charles Munch, who invited Ozawa to travel to Massachusetts for conducting classes at the Tanglewood Summer Festival. Ozawa walked away with the festival&#39;s Koussevitsky Prize, and with a scholarship to travel to Berlin for studies with arguably the most famous conductor of the day, Herbert von Karajan. During this sojourn, he also attracted the attention of New York Philharmonic conductor Leonard Bernstein, who gave Ozawa lessons and hired him as an assistant conductor for two seasons.&#xD;&#xA;Ozawa served as the music director of Chicago&#39;s Ravinia Festival from 1964 to 1968. His first major orchestral post was as the music director of the Toronto Symphony from 1965 to 1969, where he championed and recorded works by Messiaen and Takemitsu that, at the time, were rarely heard on major symphony programs. His orientation toward contemporary music only grew after he became the principal conductor of the progressive San Francisco Symphony in 1970, taking the orchestra on a European tour and remaining in his post until 1977. After returning to Tanglewood as the artistic advisor in 1970, Ozawa was hired as the music director of the Boston Symphony in 1972. The move was a bold one on the orchestra&#39;s part; Japanese musicians were not well known in the U.S. at the time, and Ozawa was just 37. He also became the artistic director of the Tanglewood Festival.&#xD;&#xA;As far back as his time in Japan, Ozawa sometimes showed a prickly personality that led him into conflict with musicians and colleagues. His tenure in Massachusetts continued this pattern as he attempted a major reorganization at Tanglewood that led to the resignation of several longtime instructors in the &#39;90s. His tenure with the Boston Symphony was also controversial, especially during his later years with the group, but what is inarguable is that his leadership, which extended until 2002, was rarely excelled for sheer durability. That year he moved to the Vienna State Opera as the principal conductor, remaining there until 2010. He continued his association with Tanglewood. In 2013, Ozawa was sidelined for treatment of esophageal cancer, but he returned to a busy schedule of recordings and guest conducting slots.&#xD;&#xA;Ozawa&#39;s recording catalog is vast, numbering more than 275 items as of the early 2020s. He made numerous recordings with the Boston Symphony for Deutsche Grammophon, RCA, Philips, and other labels. He favored contemporary music, not only by marquee names but also by lesser-known composers, and was an enthusiastic conductor of Mahler, Stravinsky, and French music, but his recorded performances range as far afield from these specialties as Gershwin. Ozawa has remained active on recordings into old age, releasing a recording of Beethoven&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat major, Op. 19, with pianist Martha Argerich on the Decca label in 2020 (in a live performance recorded several years earlier). On that recording, Ozawa led Japan&#39;s Mito Chamber Orchestra, which he had advised, supported, and often conducted since its formation in 1990. Ozawa&#39;s long list of awards includes the Kennedy Center Honors in 2015. Ozawa died in early February 2024 from heart failure. ~ James Manheim" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5182/thumb/1753259901" addedAt="1753014264" updatedAt="1753259901">

Swift shed her country roots like a second skin, revealing that she was perhaps the savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute &#34;Tim McGraw,&#34; but her second album, 2008&#39;s Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits &#34;Love Story&#34; and &#34;You Belong with Me,&#34; but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Speak Now, delivered almost two years later, consolidated that success and moved Swift into the stratosphere of superstardom. Her popularity only increased with her next three albums -- Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017) -- and found her moving assuredly into a pop realm where she already belonged. Even when she scaled back her approach with 2020&#39;s stripped-down sibling releases folklore and Evermore, she remained at the top of the pop world, a position she maintained with re-recordings of her back catalog along with albums like 2022&#39;s chart-topping Midnights and 2024&#39;s The Tortured Poets Department.&#xD;&#xA;This sense of confidence had been apparent in Taylor Swift since the beginning. The daughter of two bankers -- her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, worked at Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea, spent time as a mutual fund marketing executive -- Swift was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in suburban Wyomissing. She began to show interest in music at the age of nine, and Shania Twain wound up as her biggest formative influence. Swift started to perform regularly at local talent contests, eventually winning a chance to open for Charlie Daniels. She learned how to play guitar and began writing songs, signing a music management deal with Dan Dymtrow; her family relocated to Nashville with the intent of furthering her music career. She was just 14 years old but on the radar of the music industry, signing a development deal with RCA Records in 2004. Swift sharpened her skills with a variety of professional songwriters, forming the strongest connections with Liz Rose. Taylor&#39;s original songs earned her a deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing, but not long after that 2004 deal, she parted ways with Dymtrow and RCA, all with the intent of launching her recording career now, not later.&#xD;&#xA;Things started moving quickly once Swift came to the attention of Scott Borchetta, a former DreamWorks Records exec about to launch Big Machine Records. Borchetta saw Swift perform at a songwriters showcase at the Bluebird Cafe and he signed her to Big Machine in 2005; shortly afterward, she started work on her debut with producer Nathan Chapman, who&#39;d previously helmed demos for Taylor. Boasting original song credits on every one of the record&#39;s 11 songs (she penned three on her own), Taylor Swift appeared in October 2006 to strong reviews and Swift made sure to work the album hard, appearing at every radio or television event offered and marshaling a burgeoning fan base through the use of MySpace. &#34;Tim McGraw,&#34; the first song from the album, did well, but &#34;Teardrops on My Guitar&#34; and &#34;Our Song&#34; did better on both the pop and country charts, where she racked up five consecutive Top Ten singles. Other successes followed in the wake of the debut -- a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist (she lost to Amy Winehouse), stopgap EPs of Christmas songs -- and Swift concentrated on delivering her sophomore set, Fearless.&#xD;&#xA;Appearing in November 2008, Fearless was certified gold by the RIAA in its first week of release, and the record gained momentum throughout 2009, earning several platinum certifications as &#34;Love Story,&#34; &#34;White Horse,&#34; &#34;You Belong with Me,&#34; &#34;Fifteen,&#34; and &#34;Fearless&#34; all scaled the upper reaches of the country charts while &#34;You Belong with Me&#34; nearly topped Billboard&#39;s Hot 100. Along with the success came some headlines, first in the form of an infamous appearance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards where her acceptance speech was interrupted by Kanye West, who burst on-stage to declare that Swift&#39;s rival Beyonc&#233; deserved the award more, but her romances also started gaining attention, notably a liaison with Twilight star Taylor Lautner, who appeared with the singer in the 2009 film Valentine&#39;s Day.&#xD;&#xA;Her flirtation with the silver screen was brief, and she poured herself into her third album, Speak Now. Released in October 2010, Speak Now was another massive first-week smash that refused to lose momentum. Hit singles like &#34;Mine&#34; and &#34;Mean,&#34; which won two Grammy Awards, played a big factor in its success, not just on the country charts but on pop radio as well. Following a 2011 live album called World Tour Live: Speak Now, Swift turned toward following a pop path on her fourth album, hiring such mainstream musicians as Dan Wilson, Butch Walker, and Britney Spears producer Max Martin. This mainstream pulse was evident on &#34;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,&#34; the first single from Red. Upon its October 2012 release, Red shattered expectations by selling over a million copies in its first week, a notable achievement that was doubly impressive in an era of declining sales. Once again, Swift&#39;s album had legs: it was certified platinum four times in the U.S. and its international sales outstripped those of Speak Now. She supported Red with an international tour in 2013 and more hits came, including &#34;I Knew You Were Trouble&#34; and &#34;22.&#34;&#xD;&#xA;As Swift geared up for the release of her fifth album in 2014, she made it clear that 1989 was designed as her first &#34;documented, official&#34; pop album and that there would be no country marketing push for the record. &#34;Shake It Off,&#34; an ebullient dance-pop throwback, hit number one upon its August 2014 release. When 1989 appeared in late October 2014, it once again shot to number one and became her third straight album to sell one million copies in its first week (a new record for any artist).&#xD;&#xA;Swift gathered many awards in the subsequent year, including Billboard&#39;s Woman of the Year, the Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards, and a special 50th Anniversary Milestone Award from the CMAs. Her 1989 World Tour included Asia, North America, and Europe during the last half of 2015, and she won three Grammy Awards at the 2016 ceremonies, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video for &#34;Bad Blood.&#34; At the end of 2016, she released &#34;I Don&#39;t Wanna Live Forever,&#34; a duet with ZAYN from the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker. The single reached the Top Five across the world. Swift returned with her sixth album, Reputation, in November 2017. Preceded by the number one hit single &#34;Look What You Made Me Do,&#34; Reputation debuted at number one, and while it didn&#39;t replicate the success of 1989, the album did help underscore her popularity while also pushing her toward mature musicality.&#xD;&#xA;Reputation was Swift&#39;s final record for Big Machine. In November 2018, she signed with Universal Music Group, which distributed her new albums under its Republic Records banner. The first album under this contract was Lover. Released in August 2019, Lover was preceded by two singles, &#34;Me!&#34; and &#34;You Need to Calm Down,&#34; which both reached number two on the Hot 100 and helped push the album to number one. The acclaimed LP and two of its singles received a total of three nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards.&#xD;&#xA;Swift&#39;s plans to support Lover with a tour in 2020 were scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With some unexpected time on her hands, she wrote and recorded a new set of songs, many in collaboration with Aaron Dessner of the National; Bon Iver and longtime Swift associate Jack Antonoff also contributed. The resulting album, folklore, was released in July 2020, and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. Less than five months later, Swift released a companion album to folklore called Evermore. Featuring many of the same collaborators as its predecessor, the Grammy-nominated Evermore debuted at number one upon its December 11, 2020 release. Altogether, the sibling LPs planted Swift atop the U.S. charts for a combined 11 weeks, and folklore became the best-selling album of 2020.&#xD;&#xA;In 2021, she began the process of re-recording her back catalog after her Big Machine masters were sold off in 2019, starting with 2008&#39;s Fearless. The first of these tracks -- &#34;Love Story (Taylor&#39;s Version)&#34; -- arrived that February, with Fearless Taylor&#39;s Version] arriving in April. The new version of Fearless contained cameos from [Colbie Caillat, Keith Urban, and Maren Morris, along with several previously unheard tunes originally written during the same time period; it debuted at number one on Billboard upon its release. Swift next revisited Red, releasing Red Taylor&#39;s Version] in November 2021. Another chart-topper, this revamp of the 2012 album featured new duets with [Phoebe Bridgers, Chris Stapleton, and Ed Sheeran, along with a ten-minute version of the ballad &#34;All Too Well.&#34; Another re-recording, &#34;This Love (Taylor&#39;s Version)&#34; (originally off 1989), arrived in May 2022 and was included in the soundtrack to the coming-of-age drama The Summer I Turned Pretty.&#xD;&#xA;At the same time she was revisiting her past work, Swift opened up another chapter in her career with the October 2022 release of Midnights, an album co-produced by Jack Antonoff and featuring a duet with Lana Del Rey on &#34;Snow on the Beach.&#34; A moody, electronica-tinged album loosely conceptualized around songs the singer purportedly wrote in the middle of the night, Midnights topped numerous global charts, including the Billboard 200. In late 2022, she also had a supporting role in the David O. Russell film Amsterdam, and sales of her ensuing tour broke the record for the most concert tickets sold in a single day. By early 2023, Swift&#39;s career-spanning efforts had converged when she took home the Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Film for her ten-minute version of &#34;All Too Well.&#34; Soon after, on Valentine&#39;s Day, she released Lover Live from Paris, which captured highlights of a September 2019 performance at the Olympia on limited heart-shaped vinyl.&#xD;&#xA;Next up on the re-release schedule was Speak Now Taylor&#39;s Version], which arrived in July 2023 with six additional songs that were written for but not included on the 2010 LP. [Fall Out Boy and Paramore&#39;s Hayley Williams, both cited influences for Speak Now, appeared on two of those songs. That year, Swift also commenced her record-smashing, critically acclaimed international stadium jaunt dubbed The Eras Tour. The extended journey -- spanning over 150 shows -- was so profitable and in-demand that Swift released Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in cinemas worldwide at the end of the year. Before 2023 was over, she also moved forward in her re-release series with 1989 Taylor&#39;s Version], a revision of her pop-minded fifth album from 2014. As with many of the re-releases, the set included multiple previously unreleased songs from the same time, as well as re-recorded versions of some of [Swift&#39;s biggest hits.&#xD;&#xA;In early 2024, Midnights won the Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year, helping Swift make history by being the first artist to win the latter award four times. During her acceptance speech for Best Pop Vocal Album, she announced the April 2024 release of her next record, The Tortured Poets Department. The songwriting-focused album featured 16 new tracks, with each of four different physical editions featuring a different 17th bonus track. The album included guest features from Post Malone on the song &#34;Fortnight&#34; and Florence + the Machine on &#34;Florida!!!&#34; Just two hours after the album was released into the wild, Swift announced its expansion into a double album, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. Topping charts in over two dozen territories, it remained at number one in the U.S. for months, just as Swift continued the Eras Tour across Europe. By the end of the year, it also earned the singer a bevy of Grammy nominations, including her seventh for Album of the Year. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4919/thumb/1754165716" art="/library/metadata/4919/art/1754165716" addedAt="1753012421" updatedAt="1754165716">

It is also one of the oldest musical organizations anywhere, fulfilling traditional roles that date back centuries.&#xD;&#xA;The choir dates back to June or July of 1498 when Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I issued a decree specifying that boys&#39; voices should be the singers of the court chapel at the Hofburg Palace; the boys perform at Sunday masses there to this day. Composers who have written for the Boy&#39;s Choir include Mozart, Schubert, and Bruckner, and conductors Clemens Krauss and Hans Richter are among the choir&#39;s many distinguished musical alumni. At the height of Austro-Hungarian imperial power, the choir often performed secular concerts in military-style uniforms complete with daggers. That came to an end as the empire dissolved after World War I, but a chaplain at the court, spending his own money, reassembled the choir and created a new image featuring sailor uniforms.&#xD;&#xA;The choir gradually gained international popularity, making the first of more than 50 U.S. tours in 1932. Its experiments with music from beyond the classical tradition began in 1931 with a recording of a piece of Native American music. In 1948, choristers began attending their own boarding school at the Augarten Palace. In 1961, the choir appeared in the Walt Disney film Almost Angels; the Austrian national emblem on their uniforms dates back to that film. The Vienna Boys&#39; Choir has toured all six inhabited continents, with the membership of 100 singers divided into smaller groups that are on the road for three months at a time with a tutor and nurse. Together, the Vienna Boys&#39; Choir groups perform about 300 concerts a year.&#xD;&#xA;The Vienna Boys&#39; Choir has had a long history of recordings. Its repertory has modernized somewhat under Gerald Wirth, who became its director in 2001; recordings since then have included Vienna Boys&#39; Choir Goes Pop (2002) and A Jewish Celebration in Song (2004). The choir&#39;s Christmas albums are especially popular and include Weihnachten mit den Wiener S&#228;ngerknaben (&#34;Christmas with the Vienna Boys&#39; Choir,&#34; 2019). After a pandemic-era pause, the group returned in 2022 on the Deutsche Grammophon label with the album Together. It returned the following year with a live recording of its 525th Anniversary Concert at the Musikverein in Vienna; that album included an arrangement of a gospel number from the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. By that time, the Vienna Boys&#39; Choir had issued at least 130 albums in the digital era, plus many more LPs and 78s. ~ James Manheim" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5256/thumb/1755979855" addedAt="1753014713" updatedAt="1755979855">

With two important orchestras under his care, he was a world figure and persuasive in the music of his own country but artistically curious and increasingly interested in other areas of the repertory. After having sharpened the ensemble within his venerable St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, he wrought a similar advance within the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Accomplished without a single firing, his uplift in the accuracy of performance took place in an orchestra many regarded as already near world-class. His brilliant notions of orchestral color were likewise in evidence, stretching the Baltimore Symphony in new directions.&#xD;&#xA;Born on December 10, 1938, in the Caucasus, Temirkanov began his musical training at age nine before studying the violin and viola at the Leningrad Conservatory&#39;s School for Talented Children when he was 13. Later, he completed his studies in viola and began training as a conductor at the conservatory itself. After graduation in 1965, he made his professional conducting debut at the Mal&#239;y Opera Theatre in Leningrad, directing a performance of La Traviata. Upon winning the celebrated All-Soviet National Conducting Competition in 1966, Temirkanov was invited by Kiril Kondrashin to undertake a tour of Europe and America with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and violinist David Oistrakh. In early 1967, the conductor made his debut with the Leningrad Philharmonic and was thereupon invited to become the orchestra&#39;s assistant conductor under Yevgeny Mravinsky.&#xD;&#xA;In 1968, Temirkanov was appointed principal conductor of the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra, continuing there until his engagement as music director of the Kirov Opera and Ballet in 1976. In 1987, he made his debut at Covent Garden, leading the opera company in Kirov productions of Yevgeny Onegin, Pique Dame, and Boris Godunov. In 1980, he was appointed principal guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and in 1988, he succeeded Mravinsky as principal conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic. That year, he became the first Soviet artist granted permission to perform in the United States after cultural relations were resumed in the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan. After serving as principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1992 to 1998, Temirkanov assumed the title of conductor laureate. He also served as principal guest conductor of the Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2008.&#xD;&#xA;In Baltimore, Temirkanov&#39;s assumption of authority manifested itself with his dismissal of the orchestra&#39;s chorus, a move that rankled many but that failed to stifle his involvement with the orchestra. Temirkanov, who had been direct in deeming the Baltimore Symphony not of the first rank even before his tenure began in January 2000, nonetheless insisted the orchestra was a very good one and could be improved. Distinct improvements were apparent to critics and public alike before he left in 2006. Between 2010 and 2012, he was music director of the Teatro Regio di Parma. Among Temirkanov&#39;s many recordings are exemplary ones of the Russian repertory, especially of works by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, and Khachaturian. Temirkanov retired from conducting in February of 2022 and died on November 2, 2023, at age 84. ~ Erik Eriksson" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/5274/thumb/1753259915" addedAt="1753014798" updatedAt="1753259915">

Born Wanting Qu in 1983 in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, Wanting grew up listening to a mix of Chinese and Western artists including Jonathan Lee, Emil Wakin Chau, Avril Lavigne, Michelle Branch, Sarah McLachlan, and others. However, it wasn&#39;t until she left home to study abroad in Canada in 2000 that she began to explore her own interest in singing. During this time, Wanting sang in a rock band, and by 2008 had begun writing her own solo singer/songwriter material. In 2009, she signed to Nettwerk. A year later, her song &#34;Drenched&#34; garnered her more attention after it was used in the soundtrack to the 2010 Honk Kong film Love in the Buff. In 2012, Wanting released her debut album, Everything in the World, which went platinum in China, with Say the Words arriving the following year. In 2015, she returned with the single &#34;Love Birds.&#34; Two years later, she released her third full-length outing, LLL, which was produced by Justin Gray (John Legend, Mariah Carey, Miley Cyrus). ~ Matt Collar" index="1" thumb="/library/metadata/4829/thumb/1755980208" addedAt="1753012242" updatedAt="1755980208">

As his popularity soared around Asia with mainstream hits No 89757 (2005) and Cao Cao (2006), he established himself as one of the top male pop stars in the region. He maintained this reputation with later albums such as 2015&#39;s From M.E. to Myself and 2017&#39;s Message in a Bottle. In 2021, he branched out further into the international market with the English-language Like You Do.&#xD;&#xA;Born Lin Jun-jie in Singapore on March 27, 1981, he began his recording career in association with the label Ocean Butterflies. His debut album, Music Voyager (2003), proved particularly popular in Taiwan, leading to Best New Artist recognition at the 2003 Taiwan Golden Melody Awards. The following year, he released his second album, Second Heaven (2004), and began experiencing large-scale success in his homeland, where he won Best New Act at the Singapore Hit Awards and was chosen to sing the theme song of the National Day Parade. Lin&#39;s success continued in 2005, when he released the album No. 89757 and swept the Singapore Hit Awards, winning four honors. Subsequent albums including Cao Cao (2006) and West Side (2007) exceeded the popularity of their predecessors, further expanding his reach into mainland China with multiple wins at the Beijing Pop Music Awards. His sixth full-length, the appropriately titled Sixology, arrived in 2008, and he continued his album-per-year schedule into 2011 with ninth LP Lost N Found, his first for Warner Music Taiwan.&#xD;&#xA;For his tenth anniversary, Lin released Stories Untold, featuring guests Leehom Wang and Taiwanese rock band Mayday. After 2014&#39;s Genesis, he issued From M.E. to Myself, which featured his explorations with dummy-head recording technology. The effort won a pair of Golden Melody Awards for Best Composer and Best Mandarin Male Singer, as well as an American Pensado Award for Best Non-English song for &#34;Twilight.&#34; After a two-year break -- which saw the release of his documentary If Miracles Had a Sound -- Lin returned with album 13, Message in a Bottle, which arrived in the final days of 2017. In early 2018, he contributed vocals to the Mandarin version of Luis Fonsi&#39;s international megahit &#34;Despacito&#34; before returning to his own work with the 2019 singles &#34;Show the World&#34; and &#34;Wonderland.&#34;&#xD;&#xA;The following year, he issued Drifter, an EP that served as the first installment of a two-part project that was completed with his first English-language release, Like You Do. Arriving in 2021, the short album expanded on Drifter&#39;s sleek synth concept and featured the single &#34;Bedroom&#34; with Anne-Marie and a Steve Aoki remix of &#34;Not Tonight.&#34; ~ Neil Z.

Born in Hong Kong on April 26, 1966, she made her recording debut in 1984 in association with CBS Sony. Most notable among her many albums are her late-&#39;80s City Rhythm trilogy and her artistically daring 1991 album Wildflower, often hailed retrospectively as her masterpiece. Around the turn of the century, she abandoned Cantopop and focused her efforts instead on the international marketplace, recording albums in Mandarin, Japanese, and English. Among these international efforts, the Mandarin-language album Love, Sandy (1995) was perhaps her biggest success. In 2005 she released her first Cantonese album in almost a decade, S/L. ~ Jason Birchmeier" index="1" addedAt="1753012168" updatedAt="1754250691">

With her versatile vocal style and ability to tackle multiple genres, she&#39;s issued romantic ballads, propulsive dance-pop, and edgy hip-hop-influenced hits such as the chart-topping &#34;Ice Cream,&#34; U.S. Top Three &#34;Roll Deep,&#34; and her highest-selling hit, the multi-platinum &#34;Bubble Pop!&#34; Achieving international success, she also broke into the Japanese and U.S. markets with EPs such as 2014&#39;s A Talk and 2016&#39;s chart peak A&#39;wesome.&#xD;&#xA;Born Kim Hyun-ah in Seoul, the vocalist began her career under JYP Entertainment in 2006 as a founding member of Wonder Girls. Although she parted ways with the group the next year, she later signed with Cube Entertainment for the formation of another girl group, 4Minute. HyunA remained with the group into the early 2010s. At that time, she began her first steps toward a solo career with the release of 2011&#39;s Bubble Pop! The EP&#39;s title track became an international hit, attracting attention for both its infectious chorus and provocative music video.&#xD;&#xA;While 4Minute remained active until 2016, HyunA continued to release an EP almost each year until their official disbandment. She followed Bubble Pop! with her highest-selling effort to date, Melting, home to her first Korean number one single, &#34;Ice Cream.&#34; Busy with 4Minute duties in 2013, she returned her attention to solo material in 2014 with A Talk, a sleek set of club-friendly dance tracks. The hip-hop-indebted A+ continued HyunA&#39;s run as a defiant and confrontational figure in the K-pop world, courting more controversy with the racy video for &#34;Because I&#39;m the Best&#34; (aka &#34;Cause I&#39;m God Girl&#34; or &#34;Roll Deep&#34; in the U.S.). Featuring BtoB rapper Jung Il-hoon, the song soared into the Top Three on the Billboard World Songs chart, her biggest U.S. hit to date. The next year, she issued A&#39;wesome. Sleeker and featuring more electronic elements, the EP was her first release following 4Minute&#39;s demise. Once the group split, HyunA remained with Cube Entertainment.&#xD;&#xA;In 2017, she released Following. The EP featured appearances by Pentagon members Wooseok (&#34;Party Follow Me]&#34;) and E&#39;Dawn (&#34;Purple&#34;), and spawned the hit &#34;Babe.&#34; Later that year, she issued the popping standalone single &#34;Lip &amp; Hip&#34; and joined [Pentagon&#39;s Hui and E&#39;Dawn as part of a sub-unit group, Triple H. After news broke of a relationship between HyunA and E&#39;Dawn in 2018, Cube released them from their contracts. HyunA signed with P-Nation -- Psy&#39;s label -- in early 2019. At the end of the year, she issued the comeback single &#34;Flower Shower.&#34; ~ Neil Z.
